Both constexpr and const are used to define constants in C++, but there are key differences:

const:

- const is a cv-qualifier (constant volatile qualifier) that indicates a variable's value won't change after initialization.
- It's a runtime concept, meaning the variable's value is determined during program execution.
- const variables can be initialized dynamically, using runtime computations.

Example: const int x = foo(); (x is const, but its value is determined at runtime)

constexpr:

- constexpr is a keyword that defines a variable or function that can be evaluated at compile-time.
- It's a compile-time concept, meaning the variable's value is determined during compilation.
- constexpr variables must be initialized with a constant expression, which can be evaluated by the compiler.

Example: constexpr int x = 5; (x is constexpr, and its value is determined at compile-time)

In your example:

- constexpr int SOME_LIB_MAJOR_VERSION {1237}; defines a constant integer variable SOME_LIB_MAJOR_VERSION with the value 1237, which is evaluated at compile-time.
- const int SOME_LIB_MAJOR_VERSION {1237}; defines a constant integer variable SOME_LIB_MAJOR_VERSION with the value 1237, which is determined at runtime (although the value is obvious in this case).

In summary:

- const means "runtime constant"
- constexpr means "compile-time constant"

While both variables are constant, constexpr provides additional guarantees about compile-time evaluation, making it useful for metaprogramming and optimization.

constinit is a keyword in C++20 and later that specifies that a variable is initialized at compile-time, similar to constexpr, but with some differences.

constinit is used to define a variable that:

1. Is initialized at compile-time.
2. Has a constant expression as its initializer.
3. Is not necessarily a constexpr variable (i.e., its value may not be computable at compile-time).

In essence, constinit guarantees that the variable is initialized before the program starts running, but it doesn't require the initializer to be a constexpr.

Here's an example:

constinit int x = 42; // initialized at compile-time

constinit is useful when you want to ensure that a variable is initialized at compile-time, but the initializer may not be a constexpr (e.g., it might involve a non-constexpr function call).

Keep in mind that constinit is only available in C++20 and later versions.
