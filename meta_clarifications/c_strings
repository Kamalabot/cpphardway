C-strings, also known as null-terminated strings, have several benefits:

1. Efficient memory usage: C-strings store characters in a contiguous array, without additional overhead for string objects or metadata.
2. Fast string operations: C-strings allow for fast string manipulation, such as concatenation, copying, and searching, since the string data is stored in a contiguous block.
3. Compatibility: C-strings are widely supported and compatible with many programming languages, libraries, and system APIs.
4. Simple string literals: C-strings can be easily created using string literals, such as "hello".
5. Low-level control: C-strings provide direct access to the underlying character array, allowing for fine-grained control over string manipulation.
6. No overhead for string creation: C-strings do not require dynamic memory allocation or object creation overhead, making them efficient for small strings.
7. Wide support in C++ libraries: Many C++ libraries, such as the Standard Template Library (STL), support C-strings as a native string type.
8. Easy integration with C code: C-strings are compatible with C code, making it easy to integrate C libraries and code into C++ programs.

However, C-strings also have some limitations and potential drawbacks, such as:

- No built-in string management (e.g., memory management, bounds checking)
- Prone to errors (e.g., null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows)
- Limited functionality compared to modern string classes (e.g., std::string)

Overall, C-strings are a fundamental part of the C and C++ languages and remain a useful tool for many programming tasks, especially when performance and efficiency are critical.
