The cstdlib and ctime headers in C++ provide various functions for tasks like memory management, sorting, searching, and time manipulation. Here are some important functions from these headers:

cstdlib:

1. malloc(): Dynamically allocates memory.
2. calloc(): Dynamically allocates memory and initializes it to zero.
3. realloc(): Resizes a previously allocated memory block.
4. free(): Releases allocated memory.
5. qsort(): Sorts an array of elements.
6. bsearch(): Searches for an element in a sorted array.
7. rand(): Generates a random number.
8. srand(): Initializes the random number generator.
9. atoi(): Converts a string to an integer.
10. atol(): Converts a string to a long integer.
11. atof(): Converts a string to a floating-point number.

ctime:

1. time(): Returns the current time as a time_t object.
2. clock(): Returns the processor time as a clock_t object.
3. ctime(): Converts a time_t object to a string.
4. mktime(): Converts a struct tm object to a time_t object.
5. difftime(): Calculates the difference between two time_t objects.
6. strftime(): Formats a struct tm object as a string.
7. gmtime(): Converts a time_t object to a struct tm object representing UTC time.
8. localtime(): Converts a time_t object to a struct tm object representing local time.

These functions are essential for tasks like memory management, sorting, searching, random number generation, and time manipulation in C++.
